# Headless Components with Vite, Tailwind, and TypeScript

This repository contains examples of headless components built with Vite, Tailwind, and TypeScript. Headless components are a pattern in React development where a component does not render anything itself, but provides some functionality or behavior to its child components. Headless components are reusable and can be used across different projects.

## Technologies Used

- [React](https://react.dev/)   
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)    
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)    
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)    

## Why Headless Components?

Headless components offer a number of benefits over traditional components. Here are a few reasons why you might want to consider making your components headless:

### Reusability

Headless components can be reused across different projects and contexts, because they do not render anything themselves. By encapsulating functionality in a headless component, you can make that functionality available to other components without coupling it to a specific rendering implementation.

### Separation of Concerns

Headless components allow you to separate functionality from rendering concerns. This can make your code easier to reason about, because you can focus on one aspect of your component's behavior at a time.

### Testability

Because headless components do not render anything themselves, they can be easier to test. You can test the functionality of a headless component in isolation, without having to worry about the rendering logic.

### Flexibility

By making your components headless, you can provide a more flexible API to your consumers. Consumers can use the headless component's functionality in different contexts and with different rendering implementations, which can make your component more versatile.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/headless-sample.git
cd headless-sample
yarn install
```

Then, start the development server:

```sh
Copy code
npm run dev
This will start the Vite development server at http://localhost:3000.
```
